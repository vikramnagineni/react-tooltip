This code defines a custom hook called `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` which determines whether to use `useLayoutEffect` or `useEffect` based on the environment in which the code is running.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Importing Dependencies**:
   ```javascript
   import { useLayoutEffect, useEffect } from 'react'
   ```

   This imports the necessary hooks (`useLayoutEffect` and `useEffect`) from React.

2. **Determining the Environment**:
   ```javascript
   const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect
   ```

   - `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks if the `window` object is defined. The presence of the `window` object typically indicates that the code is running in a browser environment (as opposed to a server environment like Node.js).
   - If the code is running in a browser, it uses `useLayoutEffect`.
   - If it's running on the server (like during Server Side Rendering or SSR), it falls back to `useEffect`.

3. **Why is this needed?**:

   - `useLayoutEffect` performs synchronous side-effects after all DOM mutations, making it suitable for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering. However, when rendering on the server (SSR), there's no DOM, so using `useLayoutEffect` will produce a warning.
   - To avoid this warning and ensure compatibility with both browser and server environments, the code conditionally uses `useEffect` (which doesn't interact with the DOM directly) when on the server.

4. **Exporting the Custom Hook**:
   ```javascript
   export default useIsomorphicLayoutEffect
   ```

   This exports the `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` hook for use in other parts of the application.

In summary, `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` is a custom hook that provides a way to use the `useLayoutEffect` hook in components that may be rendered both on the client and the server without producing any warnings.
