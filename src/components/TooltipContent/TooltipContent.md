Certainly! Let's break down the code piece by piece:

### Comments:

```jsx
/* eslint-disable react/no-danger */
```

This comment is a directive for ESLint, a static code analysis tool used in JavaScript and TypeScript development. The comment disables a specific ESLint rule (`react/no-danger`) for the entire file. The rule in question warns against the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React because of the potential risk of introducing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

### Imports:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import type { ITooltipContent } from './TooltipContentTypes'
```

- The first line imports the React object, which is necessary to use JSX and React functionalities.
- The second line imports a TypeScript type named `ITooltipContent` from a local module `TooltipContentTypes`. The `type` keyword here explicitly states that you're importing a type and not a value or a function.

### Component Definition:

```jsx
const TooltipContent = ({ content }: ITooltipContent) => {
  return <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content }} />
}
```

- The component `TooltipContent` is defined as a functional component.
- It expects a single prop named `content`, and the type of this prop is defined by the `ITooltipContent` type.
- Within the component, a `span` element is returned. Instead of rendering children or text content, it uses the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop. This prop is a React mechanism for inserting raw HTML into an element.
  - The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop expects an object with a key of `__html` containing the raw HTML string to be rendered. In this case, the `content` prop passed to the component is used as the raw HTML.

### Export:

```jsx
export default TooltipContent
```

This line exports the `TooltipContent` component as the default export from the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

### Overall Explanation:

The `TooltipContent` component is a simple utility component that takes raw HTML content as a prop and renders it within a `span` element. The use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is potentially risky as it can introduce XSS vulnerabilities if not handled properly. It's vital to ensure that any content passed to this component is sanitized and safe to be rendered as raw HTML. The ESLint rule `react/no-danger` is disabled for this file to prevent warnings about the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, but developers should be cautious and aware of the risks associated with its usage.
