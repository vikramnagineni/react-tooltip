This code snippet consists of some React hooks and a function that seem to be involved in controlling the visibility and rendering behavior of a component (likely a tooltip or a modal). Let's break down each part:

### useIsomorphicLayoutEffect Hook:

This hook (`useIsomorphicLayoutEffect`) is not a standard React hook. It's presumably a custom hook that acts like `useLayoutEffect` in a browser environment and like `useEffect` in a server-side rendering environment (to avoid warnings related to `useLayoutEffect` during server-side rendering). 

The hook's body:

```javascript
useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => {
  mounted.current = true;
  return () => {
    mounted.current = false;
  };
}, []);
```

This code sets a `mounted` ref to `true` when the component mounts and to `false` when it unmounts. This pattern is commonly used to prevent state updates on unmounted components, which can lead to errors.

### useEffect Hook:

This effect is related to hiding and showing the tooltip/modal:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!show) {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setRendered(false);
    }, 150);
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    };
  }
  return () => null;
}, [show]);
```

If the `show` state/prop is `false` (meaning the tooltip/modal is not shown), it sets a timeout to update the `rendered` state to `false` after 150ms. This likely removes the tooltip/modal from the DOM. The delay ensures smoother transitions between showing and hiding. The cleanup function of the effect clears the timeout to prevent potential errors or unwanted behavior.

### handleShow Function:

This function seems to control the visibility of the tooltip/modal:

```javascript
const handleShow = (value: boolean) => {
  if (!mounted.current) {
    return;
  }
  if (value) {
    setRendered(true);
  }
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (!mounted.current) {
      return;
    }
    setIsOpen?.(value);
    if (isOpen === undefined) {
      setShow(value);
    }
  }, 10);
};
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. If the component is not mounted (`mounted.current` is `false`), it exits early.
2. If the passed `value` is `true` (indicating the tooltip/modal should be shown), it immediately sets the `rendered` state to `true`.
3. After a short delay of 10ms (likely to ensure that rendering calculations have been completed), it checks the `mounted` ref again.
4. If provided, the external state setter `setIsOpen` is called with the passed `value`. If `isOpen` is `undefined`, it updates the local `show` state with the passed `value`.

### Summary:

The code manages the rendering and visibility of a component (presumably a tooltip or modal). It ensures that:

1. Updates to the component state are not made after the component has unmounted.
2. The component's visibility is controlled with slight delays to account for rendering calculations and to ensure smoother transitions.
3. A custom hook (`useIsomorphicLayoutEffect`) is used to handle component mounting and unmounting in a way that's compatible with both browser and server-side environments.


This code revolves around the logic for showing and hiding a tooltip with optional delays. Let's break it down:

### First `useEffect`:

This effect listens for changes in the `isOpen` prop. When `isOpen` is altered from outside the component, this effect will replicate the behavior of the `handleShow()` function:

1. If `isOpen` is `undefined`, the effect does nothing.
2. If `isOpen` is `true`, it sets `rendered` to `true`.
3. After a 10ms delay, it updates the local `show` state to the value of `isOpen`.
4. The cleanup function clears the timeout to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Second `useEffect`:

This effect tracks the state of the tooltip visibility (`show`):

1. If the current state of `show` is the same as its previous value (tracked by `wasShowing.current`), the effect does nothing.
2. Otherwise, it updates the `wasShowing` ref and triggers either the `afterShow` or `afterHide` callbacks, depending on the visibility state.

### handleShowTooltipDelayed:

This function is used to show the tooltip after a delay (`delayShow`):

1. Any existing timeout is cleared.
2. A new timeout is set to call `handleShow(true)` after the specified delay.

### handleHideTooltipDelayed:

This function hides the tooltip after an optional delay:

1. Any existing timeout is cleared.
2. A new timeout is set to check if the tooltip is being hovered. If not, it calls `handleShow(false)` after the specified delay.

### handleShowTooltip:

This function handles the logic for showing the tooltip when an event occurs:

1. It checks if the event target is still connected to the DOM.
2. If there's a `delayShow`, it invokes `handleShowTooltipDelayed`, otherwise, it shows the tooltip immediately.
3. It sets the current target as the active anchor for the tooltip.
4. Any existing hide timeout is cleared.

### handleHideTooltip:

This function handles the logic for hiding the tooltip:

1. If the tooltip is `clickable`, it allows some time for the mouse to possibly reach the tooltip before hiding it.
2. If there's a `delayHide`, it invokes `handleHideTooltipDelayed`. Otherwise, it hides the tooltip immediately.
3. Any existing show timeout is cleared.

### Summary:

The code controls the visibility and behavior of a tooltip based on various conditions and interactions. There are optional delays before showing or hiding the tooltip, which can be customized via `delayShow` and `delayHide`. The logic also accounts for scenarios where the tooltip might be clickable or there might be a gap between the anchor and the tooltip. Callback functions `afterShow` and `afterHide` allow for additional actions to be performed when the tooltip is shown or hidden, respectively.

The provided code seems to manage the positioning and visibility of a tooltip in response to various user interactions. Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities:

### 1. `handleTooltipPosition`:

This function computes the position of the tooltip based on the given `{ x, y }` coordinates:

- A `virtualElement` is created that mimics an HTML element but is positioned exactly at the given `{ x, y }` coordinates.
- The `computeTooltipPosition` function is then called, which likely determines where the tooltip should be positioned relative to this `virtualElement` and adjusts for other factors (like the arrow, offsets, etc.).
- The computed styles for both the tooltip and its arrow are then applied using state setters (`setInlineStyles` and `setInlineArrowStyles`).

### 2. `handleMouseMove`:

This function is likely attached to a `mousemove` event listener:

- It captures the current mouse position (`clientX` and `clientY`).
- It then calls `handleTooltipPosition` to adjust the tooltip's position based on the current mouse position.
- The last position of the mouse is stored in the `lastFloatPosition` ref.

### 3. `handleClickTooltipAnchor`:

This function handles what should happen when the tooltip's anchor (the element triggering the tooltip) is clicked:

- It shows the tooltip.
- If there's a `delayHide`, it schedules the tooltip to be hidden after that delay.

### 4. `handleClickOutsideAnchors`:

This function handles what should happen when a click occurs outside of the tooltip and its anchors:

- If the click is on an anchor or the tooltip itself, it does nothing.
- Otherwise, it hides the tooltip and clears any show timeout.

### 5. `debouncedHandleShowTooltip` and `debouncedHandleHideTooltip`:

These are debounced versions of the `handleShowTooltip` and `handleHideTooltip` functions. Debouncing ensures that these functions don't get called too frequently in quick succession, which can be useful to prevent flickering or other unwanted behavior.

### 6. `updateTooltipPosition`:

This `useCallback` function determines how the tooltip should be positioned:

- If a `position` is provided, it uses that to position the tooltip.
- If the `float` prop is set, it either uses the last floating position or doesn't adjust the position.
- If neither of the above conditions are met, it calculates the tooltip's position based on the current `activeAnchor` and other provided parameters.
  
The dependencies of this `useCallback` ensure that the position is recalculated whenever any related props or state change.

### Summary:

This code is centered around managing the positioning and behavior of a tooltip component. The tooltip can either be attached to a fixed element (an anchor) or float freely based on mouse movements. It can also adjust its position in response to clicks, and it ensures that the tooltip is hidden when clicking outside of relevant areas.


The provided code is a `useEffect` hook that manages various event listeners to handle the behavior of a tooltip. Let's break down its functionality step by step:

### 1. **Populating elementRefs**:
It starts by creating a `Set` named `elementRefs` to collect references to all elements (anchors) that can trigger the tooltip.

### 2. **Scroll/Resize Event Handling**:
If the `closeOnScroll` prop is true, event listeners are added to the window, the scroll parent of the active anchor, and the scroll parent of the tooltip itself. These listeners close the tooltip when a scroll event occurs.

For the `closeOnResize` prop, there are two scenarios:
- If true, an event listener is added to the window to close the tooltip when the window is resized.
- Otherwise, an `autoUpdate` function is called, which likely checks for resizes of the tooltip or the active anchor and updates its position.

### 3. **Escape Key Handling**:
If the `closeOnEsc` prop is true, an event listener is added to the window to close the tooltip when the Escape key is pressed.

### 4. **Event Configuration for Anchors**:
Based on the provided props, a list of events (`enabledEvents`) is populated which will be used to add event listeners to the anchors in `elementRefs`. These events determine when the tooltip should show or hide.

### 5. **Tooltip Hover Handling**:
If the tooltip is `clickable` and not set to open on click, event listeners are added to the tooltip itself. These listeners track when the mouse enters and leaves the tooltip, which affects its visibility.

### 6. **Adding Event Listeners to Anchors**:
Event listeners are added to each anchor in the `elementRefs` set based on the `enabledEvents` configuration.

### 7. **Cleanup**:
The return function of the `useEffect` is the cleanup function. It ensures that all the added event listeners are removed when the component unmounts or when the dependencies of the `useEffect` change. This is essential to avoid memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

### 8. **Dependencies**:
The `useEffect` has a dependency array which includes `activeAnchor`, `updateTooltipPosition`, `rendered`, `anchorRefs`, `anchorsBySelect`, `closeOnEsc`, and `events`. The `useEffect` will re-run whenever any of these dependencies change.

### Summary:
This `useEffect` is responsible for managing the dynamic behavior of a tooltip based on various user interactions and prop configurations. It ensures the tooltip shows or hides based on mouse movements, clicks, keypresses, and other events. The cleanup function ensures that all added event listeners are removed appropriately.


This code consists of multiple `useEffect` hooks. Let's break down each of them:

### 1. **Monitoring DOM for Anchor Changes**:
The first `useEffect` is observing the DOM for changes related to the tooltip anchors. It watches for new anchors being added, old ones being removed, or the `data-tooltip-id` attribute changing.

- If an element that matches the provided selector (or has the `data-tooltip-id` attribute) is added to the DOM, it's considered a new anchor.
- If the active anchor is removed from the DOM, the tooltip is hidden.
- The observed changes are achieved using the `MutationObserver`.

### 2. **Updating Tooltip Position**:
The second `useEffect` simply triggers the `updateTooltipPosition` function whenever it changes, ensuring that the tooltip's position is recalculated.

### 3. **Monitoring Tooltip Content Size**:
This `useEffect` watches for size changes in the tooltip's content using the `ResizeObserver`. If the content size changes (maybe due to dynamic content or responsive adjustments), the tooltip position is recalculated.

### 4. **Setting Active Anchor**:
This `useEffect` checks if there's an active anchor and if it's amongst the allowed anchors (either by ID or by the provided selector). If not, it resets the active anchor to the first valid one.

### 5. **Cleanup Timers**:
The last `useEffect` is a cleanup effect that runs only when the component is unmounted (since its dependency array is empty). It ensures that any lingering timers related to showing or hiding the tooltip are cleared, preventing potential issues from timers firing after the component has been unmounted.

### Summary:
These hooks collectively manage the tooltip's behavior in response to various changes:
- DOM mutations related to anchors.
- Size changes in the tooltip content.
- Updates in the tooltip's position function.
- Component unmounting.

They ensure that the tooltip appears, hides, and repositions correctly based on user interactions and other dynamic changes in the app.

This code contains a `useEffect` hook and a conditional rendering of a tooltip component. Let's break it down:

### 1. **Fetching Anchors from DOM**:
The `useEffect` hook looks for anchor elements in the DOM that match a given selector and updates the state with those anchors.

- If no `anchorSelect` is provided but there's an `id`, it constructs a default selector to find elements with a specific `data-tooltip-id` attribute.
- If there's no selector at all, it doesn't proceed.
- It then tries to query the DOM for elements matching the selector. If successful, the state is updated with these anchor elements. If there's an error (e.g., an invalid selector), the state is reset with an empty list.

### 2. **Tooltip Rendering Condition**:
The variable `canShow` determines if the tooltip should be visible. It checks several conditions:
- The tooltip shouldn't be explicitly hidden.
- There should be content to show in the tooltip.
- The tooltip should be in a "show" state.
- There should be inline styles computed for the tooltip's position.

### 3. **Rendering the Tooltip**:
The tooltip is conditionally rendered based on the `rendered` state. If `rendered` is true, the tooltip component is returned; otherwise, `null` is returned.

The tooltip consists of two main parts:
- The main tooltip content (`<WrapperElement> ... </WrapperElement>`).
- An arrow pointing towards the anchor (`<WrapperElement className={...} />`).

The tooltip and its arrow have dynamic class names and styles determined by various conditions and props, such as:
- `variant`, `actualPlacement`, `positionStrategy`, and `clickable` for the tooltip's appearance and behavior.
- `noArrow` to decide whether the arrow should be displayed.

Additionally, the tooltip and its arrow have styles applied to them:
- `externalStyles` and `inlineStyles` for the tooltip.
- `inlineArrowStyles` for the arrow, including a potential gradient background if an `arrowColor` is provided.

In essence, this code handles the dynamic rendering of a tooltip, adjusting its appearance and visibility based on various conditions and properties.
